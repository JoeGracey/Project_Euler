            Add the even-valued numbers together whose values
            do not exceed four million.

            Determine if the first two numbers are even.
            Add one to a variable and the other to another variable?
            If the numbers are even, add them together.
            Find the next even number.
            Add the sum of the previous two numbers with the current even number.

I did not figure this out on my own. I really tried to solve but I couldn't, and whats frustrating
 is I'm struggling to understand the answer.
